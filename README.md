Solutions to HackerRank 30Days Challenge in Python 3

I hope this repo could help anyone who find this solutions. Also comments or improvements would be apreciated. This is only for learning purposes. Problems made by their Authors on HackerRank.

## Day 0: Hello World!
Here we go!
## Day 1: Data Types
No problem with this
## Day 2: Operators
Simple maths
## Day 3: Intro to conditional statements
Attention to your conditional statements, also interesting to check how to implement multime conditions on the same statement. 
```
if all( [cond1 == 'val1', cond2 == 'val2', cond3 == 'val3', cond4 == 'val4'] ):

if any( [cond1 == 'val1', cond2 == 'val2', cond3 == 'val3', cond4 == 'val4'] ):
```

## Day 4: Class vs. Instance
I learned that you can set conditions over the initial properties just after their declarations. Also practice on conditionals
## Day 5: Loops
Easy maths and loops on Python. Iterables are very interesting. Lists, Tuples, dictionaries and sets are iterables. All have a iter() method
## Day 6: Let's Review
Good practice on string slices
## Day 7: Arrays
Appliying slice and string to list methods
## Day 8: Dictionaries and Maps
First take on Dictionaries, but it forces you to find about error handling, that is a tip to manage unknown numbers of inputs.
## Day 9: Recursion 3
Not much to say, basics of recursion
## Day 10: Binary Numbers
Looks simple at first but had to spend some time thinking how to count the max of ones
## Day 11: 2D Arrays
Good exercise to handle matrix index
## Day 12: Inheritance
Just declaration of sub class, but good example to keep things simple
