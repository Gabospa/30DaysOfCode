Solutions to HackerRank 30Days Challenge in Python 3

I hope this repo could help anyone who find this solutions. Also comments or improvements would be apreciated. This is only for learning purposes. Problems made by their Authors on HackerRank.

## Day 0: Hello World!
Here we go!
## Day 1: Data Types
No problem with this
## Day 2: Operators
Simple maths
## Day 3: Intro to conditional statements
Attention to your conditional statements, also interesting to check how to implement multime conditions on the same statement. 
```
if all( [cond1 == 'val1', cond2 == 'val2', cond3 == 'val3', cond4 == 'val4'] ):

if any( [cond1 == 'val1', cond2 == 'val2', cond3 == 'val3', cond4 == 'val4'] ):
```
From S.Lott on Stack Overflow
## Day 4: Class vs. Instance
I learned that you can set conditions over the initial properties just after their declarations. Also practice on conditionals
## Day 5: Loops
Easy maths and loops on Python. Iterables are very interesting. Lists, Tuples, dictionaries and sets are iterables. All have a iter() method
## Day 6: Let's Review
Good practice on string slices
## Day 7: Arrays
Appliying slice and string to list methods
## Day 8: Dictionaries and Maps
First take on Dictionaries, but it forces you to find about error handling, that is a tip to manage unknown numbers of inputs.
## Day 9: Recursion 3
Not much to say, basics of recursion
## Day 10: Binary Numbers
Looks simple at first but had to spend some time thinking how to count the max of ones
## Day 11: 2D Arrays
Good exercise to handle matrix index
## Day 12: Inheritance
Just declaration of sub class, but good example to keep things simple
## Day 13: Abstract Classes
Abstract Classes could have a constructor and methods. There are serveral ways to implement empty methods.
## Day 14: Scope
Two loop cycles that check abs diference between elements and keep the max.
## Day 15: Linked-List
The most important thing is to understand how to traverse a linked list.
## Day 16: Exceptions
In this case, when the input type is wrong, the type of error is ValueError
## Day 17: More Exception
Important use, an exception could be raised from a Class and be used over the main program
## Day 18: Queues and Stacks
Stacks are normal lists with propper care, queues came from collections, and remember to use popleft, not pop.
## Day 19: Interfaces
Important to learn about Abstract Classes and Interfaces. Python only have Abstract classes, Java uses Interfaces for multiple inheritance.
## Day 20: Sorting
Implementantion of Bubble Sort
## Day 21: Generics
Only file on C++. Generics was not available on Python, but you only need to undestand the logic of generics, which means a single function or class who could recive different type of inputs. Also important how to print statements on C++.
## Day 22: Binary Search Trees
Have to find the height of trees, which is the definition.
## Day 23: BST Level Order Traversal
The key is using a queue, understanding data structures. This is Breadth First Search
## Day 24 : More Linked Lists
Had to fight for a while with edge cases, is not hard but thing about several repeated values.
## Day 25: Running Time and Complexity
You should always try to understand the algorithm before trying to code it. Why O(n**0.5)?. That's always lower than O(n)
## Day 26: Nested Logic
Beware of edge cases, logic is simple but keep in mind end of months and other special cases
## Day 27: Testing
Important to understand the meaning of the test, you just have to be clear with the results you want. 
## Day 28: RegEx, Patterns, and Intro to databases
Not so much about databases but simple example of Regex.
## Day 29: Bitwise AND
This was a genuine surprise, logic by brute force is simple, but you should try it and later improve it. There is a elegant solution to this problems. I had to look for this solution which only improves runtime but is not the best. The road is just beggining.
